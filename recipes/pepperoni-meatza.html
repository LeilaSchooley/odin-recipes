    <img src="./pepperoni.jpeg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This low-carb, gluten-free, paleo "pizza" uses ground beef as the crust to
      create a filling and absolutely delicious meal. Feel free to add whatever
      toppings you normally eat on pizza. "I loved this!" says recipe reviewer
      NessTheMess. "I'm doing a gluten-free low-carb diet and this was perfect!"
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon caraway seeds (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 pounds extra lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Â½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package sliced pepperoni, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix together salt, caraway seeds, oregano, garlic salt, ground black
        pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix ground beef and eggs in a mixing bowl until thoroughly incorporated.
        Add Parmesan cheese and seasoning mixture to beef; combine. Press ground
        beef mixture into a 12x17-inch pan, spread out evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no longer pink, about 10
        minutes. Drain grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and turn on the oven's
        broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over baked meat, followed by
        tomato sauce in an even layer. Sprinkle another 1/3 of the mozzarella
        cheese over the sauce and top with slices of pepperoni. Sprinkle
        remaining mozzarella cheese over pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil until cheese is melted, bubbling, and lightly browned, 3 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
