<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This is the speedy, easy version of boeuf Bourguignon, the classic French
  slow-cooked beef dish. Delicious over cooked egg noodles or mashed potatoes.
  Leftovers taste great as well - just reheat on the stove.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
  <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
  <li>4 slices thick-cut hickory smoked bacon, cut into small cubes</li>
  <li>1 medium white onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced baby portobello mushrooms</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
  <li>1 cups dry red wine</li>
  <li>1 pound carrots, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Toss together beef pieces, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until fat is rendered and
    bacon is beginning to brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Add seasoned beef to bacon and
    cook, stirring often, until well browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add onion and
    cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic
    and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add mushrooms and tomato paste to mixture and cook, stirring occasionally,
    for 4 minutes. Stir in broth, wine, and carrots and bring mixture to a boil.
    Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 40 to 45 minutes or until beef is
    fork-tender.
  </li>
  <li>
    Uncover and remove 1/2 cup broth to a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Whisk in
    flour until completely combined and smooth. Stir flour mixture back into
    beef mixture and stir constantly until thickened slightly, 4 to 5 minutes.
    Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.
